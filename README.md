# React Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of React projects developed during my learning journey. Each project demonstrates different React concepts and features, from basic hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to more advanced topics like `useReducer`, `useContext`, and React Router.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **useState**

- **Birthday Reminder**: A simple project that uses the `useState` hook to manage and display a list of birthdays.

### 2. **useEffect and Conditional Rendering**

- **Tours**: Displays a list of tours fetched from an API, with options to refresh or remove a tour.
- **Reviews-Slider**: A carousel of reviews with navigation.
- **Accordian**: An FAQ-like project with collapsible answers.
- **Restaurant Menu**: A dynamic menu app that filters items based on categories.
- **Tabs**: Displays data in a tabbed interface with dynamic content.
- **Slider**: An image slider project with automatic and manual transitions.
- **Lorem Ipsum Generator**: Generates random placeholder text based on user input.

### 3. **useReducer and useContext**

- **Shopping Cart**: A shopping cart app with `useReducer` for state management and `useContext` for passing state across components.

### 4. **useContenx With React Routers**

### 5. **Routing with Auth**

- A MERN stack project implementing authentication and routing. Users are fetched from the database, and routes are protected based on the authentication state. It includes `useContext` for passing state across components.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a comprehensive reference for learning React concepts and building foundational projects. Feel free to explore the projects, modify them, and use them as a learning resource.
